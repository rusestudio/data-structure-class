//hash table

//define struct hashtable
//node* is type of address *buckets, node* also adress
//so node** buckets - coz in bucket id address type and the bucket we gonna make also address type, so use node**
//capacity - n
//int size - m

//create hashtable
//malloc hashtable
//initialize capacity n size 
//capacity = maxsize define
//size =0

//make bucket
//calloc sizeof use table->capacity. based on how many bucket wanna make
//(Node**)calloc(table->capacity, sizeof(Node*));
//node** is the bucket address that original have, and node* is the data node that also in address type
//type node*
//return table





//main

//input n 
//creta hashtable based on input
//type struct hashtable varname table = createtable()
//input m loop based on n 
//insert data in table (table,num)

//input m wanna find data
